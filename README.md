# Cool Compiler (CC)
I wrote this project for Compiler course at Shahid Beheshti University Summer 2021.
Java, [PGen](https://github.com/Borjianamin98/PGen), [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) are the tools that
I've leveraged to do this project. list of features is at the end of this document;
It shows the current features of the compiler, and the features that need to be done. The syntax is fairly simple. here's a sample:
